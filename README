This space is dedicated to assign reasonable prices to the different pokémons

Price check rules:
	1. If the pokemons have no price assigned you can just add one
        
	2. If is already a price assigned and you are not okay with it just add a new one before the already existing separated with /
		Exemple: @       Caterpie|Lvl  15|25|25|28|20|27|27|Grass    |200m
		       > @       Caterpie|Lvl  15|25|25|28|20|27|27|Grass    |100k / 200m
           
	3. If is already a price assigned and you are oki with it just add a +before
		Exemple: @       Caterpie|Lvl  15|25|25|28|20|27|27|Grass    |100k / 200m
		       > @       Caterpie|Lvl  15|25|25|28|20|27|27|Grass    |+100k / 200m
           This allows to support a price placed by someone else,
           if more then one price is present the one with more + will be taken in consideration
           if there are several prices with the same number of + the leftmost will be taken into consideration
	   
        4. The hidden power must be taken into consideration if and only if it is beneficial for the pokémon in question
           
        5. If the pokémon has no value you can just remove the @ instead of putting a price 0
           But that doesn't mean that cheap pokémons should be ignored

Additional informations:
        Pokemon have been divided into the following categories
                Shiny 28+
                Shiny
                Non Shiny 28+
                Non Shiny 20+
                Non Shiny
                
        This allows to reduce the search field of the algorithm
        and allows to achieve better results since we do not have an infinite number of data at our disposal.
